## flywheel/dicom-send

Build context for a [Flywheel Gear](https://github.com/flywheel-io/gears/tree/master/spec) to execute DCMTK's [storescu](https://support.dcmtk.org/docs/storescu.html) to send DICOM data from a [Flywheel](flywheel.io) instance to a DICOM server. The DICOM server must be reachable from the host of the [Flywheel](flywheel.io) instance.
